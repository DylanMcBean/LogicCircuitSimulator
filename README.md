# LogicCircuitSimulator

## What is this?
so you might be wondering what this is, and the easy answer is that is is just a logic cursuit simulator. this is not going to be 100% accurate to real life circuits though; with timing delays and all of that. this is just a fun project i have been working on and thought other people might enjoy playing with it aswell

## How can I run this?
* The first way you can run this is if you have processing you can run the direct source code
* The second way is you run one of the release versions

## Can I contribute?
If you have any idea of stuff to add, please post it in the issues tab. and if I deem it apropriate or it gets enough likes then I will try and impliment it in the next version

## Why only windows?
if you do not have processing ro run the direct source code. then I'm very sorry but the only built I could get working and test where the windows versions' i will try and get Mac/Apple and Linux versions working in the near future if I can.
