# LogicCircuitSimulator

## What is this?
You might be wondering what this is, and the easy answer is that it is just a logic circuit simulator. This will not be 100% accurate to real-life circuits, though, with timing delays and all of that. this is just a fun project I have been working on, and I thought other people might enjoy playing with it as well

## How can I run this?
* The first way you can run this is if you have processing you can run the direct source code [Processing Download Page](https://processing.org/download/)
* The second way is you run one of the release versions [Latest Release](https://github.com/DylanMcBean/LogicCircuitSimulator/releases/tag/v2.21)

## Can I contribute?
If you have any idea of stuff to add, please post it in the issues tab. If I deem it appropriate or get enough likes, I will try and implement it in the next version.

## Why only windows?
Suppose you do not have processing to run the direct source code. I'm very sorry but the only built I could get working and test were the windows versions' i will try and get Mac/Apple and Linux versions working shortly.
